SSL hanshake procedure
- Client Hello: includes the session ID, cipher suites
supported by the clients, and various extensions, such as the server name.
- Server Hello: includes the assigned session ID (if not reconnecting), chosen
cipher suite, and certificate.
- Alter: in the case that anything goes wrong, e.g., untrusted certificate.

Certificate
- Subject: the server identified in the certificate.
- Issuer: the CA that signs the certificate.
- Extension -> AuthorityKeyIdentifier: should match the SubjectKeyIdentifier in
  the next certificate that signs the current one.

Certificate chain
- Suppose A -> B is a partial chain. The certificate A is signed by the
  private-key of B, and therefore can be verified by the public-key of B.
- The validation procedure goes from the end-entity, i.e., the certificate whose
  subject is our targeted server, and verifies that each certificate by its
  successor's public-key. If we can reach the root certificate, which is
  self-signed, the procedure succeeds.

RSA
- Euler's totient function: $$\phi(n) =$$ # of positive integers that are smaller
  than n and coprime with n.
- Euler's theorem: for any a and n where gcd(a, n) = 1, a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1
  (mod n).
- RSA theorem: for primes p and q, a^{(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 (mod pq).
- Procedure
  1. Pick p and q, let n = pq and \phi = (p-1)(q-1). Discard p and q then.
  2. Pick e and d, so that ed \equiv 1 (mod \phi). The pair (e, n) is the public
  key, where e is called the exponent and n is called the modulus. The pair (d,
  n) is the private key.
  3. To encrypt, convert the message into an integer m < n, and then compute c
  \equiv m^e (mod n). The number m should also be coprime with n. Since n = pq,
  the number of positive integers that are not coprime with n equals to p + q -
  1 (\phi(pq) = \phi(p)\phi(q), for p and q that gcd(p, q) = 1). Therefore,
  almost all the number less than n are coprime with n as n goes large.
  4. To decrypt, raise c to c^d. It can be shown that c^d \equiv m (mod n),
  which gives back the original message.
    - Note that e and d are "symmetric" in the sense that you can either encrypt
      with e or d, and decrypt with the other.
    - It does not matter how we choose d as long as e*d is in the desired
      equivalence group. Also, it is not necessary to know the exact d one had
      chosen for the same reason. One can decrypt even with a different d as
      long as ed \equiv 1 (mod \phi).

Practical usage
- To install root certificate under Ubuntu, first copy the certificate to
  /usr/share/ca-certificates. Then do "dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates" to
  update /etc/ca-certificates.conf and /etc/ssl/certs.
- To verify a certificate, use "openssl verify".
