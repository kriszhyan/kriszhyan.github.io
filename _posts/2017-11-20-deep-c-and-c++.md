title: Deep C (and C++)

During the search of some good reference on C++ object layout, I found [an
excellent presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/olvemaudal/deep-c) about
C/C++ in depth by Olve Maudal and Jon Jagger. I was having a lot fun to read the
slides, and in the end, did learn stuffs that I was not aware of. Good job, Olve
and Jon.
